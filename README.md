# **Automatic Deployment of Node.js Express Server to Self-Hosted Ubuntu VPS**

This guide walks you through automating the deployment of your **Node.js Express server** to a self-hosted Ubuntu Virtual Private Server (VPS) using **GitHub Actions**.

---

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following ready:
1. A **GitHub account**.
2. A **VPS** running Ubuntu (e.g., AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.).
3. Your **Node.js Express server** code pushed to a GitHub repository.
4. Basic knowledge of the command-line interface (CLI).

---

## **Step 1: Set Up Your Ubuntu VPS**

1. **Log in to your VPS**:
   ```bash
   ssh username@your-vps-ip
   ```

2. **Update the system and install necessary tools**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install -y curl git tar
   ```

3. **Install Node.js and PM2**:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt install -y nodejs
   sudo npm install -g pm2
   ```

4. **Optional - Set up a firewall**:
   Configure your firewall to allow SSH, HTTP, and your application port (e.g., `3000`):
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
   sudo ufw allow 3000
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

---

## **Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository**

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository.
2. Push your Node.js Express server code to the repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

## **Step 3: Set Up a Self-Hosted Runner on Your VPS**

1. **Navigate to your GitHub Repository**:
   - Go to **Settings > Actions > Runners** and click **Add Runner**.

2. **Install the GitHub Runner**:
   Follow the instructions for Linux provided on GitHub, or run:
   ```bash
   cd ~
   curl -o actions-runner-linux-x64.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/latest/download/actions-runner-linux-x64.tar.gz
   mkdir actions-runner && tar xzf actions-runner-linux-x64.tar.gz -C actions-runner
   cd actions-runner
   ```

3. **Configure the Runner**:
   Replace `REPO_URL` and `YOUR_TOKEN` with your repository URL and the token provided during setup:
   ```bash
   ./config.sh --url https://github.com/your-username/your-repo --token YOUR_TOKEN
   ```

4. **Start the Runner**:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

5. **Optional - Run as a Service**:
   To ensure the runner starts on boot:
   ```bash
   sudo ./svc.sh install
   sudo ./svc.sh start
   ```

---

## **Step 4: Create the GitHub Workflow**

1. Inside your repository, create the directory `.github/workflows`.
2. Add a new file called `deploy.yml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to Self-Hosted VPS

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     deploy:
       name: Deploy to Self-Hosted VPS
       runs-on: self-hosted

       steps:
         # Step 1: Checkout repository
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         # Step 2: Use Node.js
         - name: Use Node.js
           uses: actions/setup-node@v2
           with:
             node-version: '16.x'

         # Step 3: Install dependencies
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: |
             npm install --frozen-lockfile
             npm install -g pm2

         # Step 4: Configure environment variables
         - name: Configure environment
           run: echo "SERVER_PORT=${{ secrets.SERVER_PORT }}" >> .env

         # Step 5: Build application (if applicable)
         - name: Build application
           run: npm run build

         # Step 6: Start the application with PM2
         - name: Start application
           run: pm2 start npm --name "my-app" -- start
   ```

---

## **Step 5: Configure GitHub Secrets**

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings > Secrets** and click **New repository secret**.
3. Add the required secrets:
   - **`SERVER_PORT`**: The port number your app will run on (e.g., `3000`).
   - Add any other environment variables your app requires.

---

## **Step 6: Trigger the Workflow**

1. Push changes to the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy to VPS"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the workflow.

---

## **Step 7: Monitor and Test**

1. **Check Runner Status**:
   On GitHub, go to **Settings > Actions > Runners**. Ensure your runner is listed as **online**.

2. **Check Workflow Logs**:
   If the deployment fails, review the logs in the **Actions** tab to debug any issues.

3. **Test Your Application**:
   Visit your VPS IP or domain at the specified port (e.g., `http://your-vps-ip:3000`) to ensure your Node.js application is running.

---

### **Additional Tips**
1. **Using a Custom Domain**: 
   Set up a reverse proxy like **Nginx** to serve your app over a custom domain with HTTPS.

2. **Automate with PM2**:
   PM2 ensures your application restarts if it crashes:
   ```bash
   pm2 startup
   pm2 save
   ```

3. **Monitoring**:
   Use `pm2 monit` to monitor your application in real-time.
